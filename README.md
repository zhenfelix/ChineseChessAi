# ChineseChessAi

How to:
`qmake && make`

Features:
- 3 seperate parts, display, game engine(stones) and player;
- qt based GUI interface, responsible for listening to click event and repaint chess board, and sinal and slot in qt is responsible for communication between frontend and backend (game engine);
- signals and slot, observer pattern
- game engine and stone classes, responsible for all kinds of legal board movements (including undo and flip) and board evaluation etc;
- game engine, virtual Clone member function as a proxy to avoid virtual constructor, in implementing chessboard copy and its chess stone copy
- negmax with alpha bete pruning
- how to measure performance?
- player subclass are implemented with different AI algorithms, the bruteforce minimax can be optimized with alpha-beta pruning (~30x speed-up), increasing search depth from 4 to 5 in ~1s, furthermore, with ordered movements optimization, we can achieve another ~20x speed-up, making 6-level search in ~1s possible.
- position evaluation function, Quiescence search(heuristic search)
- with transipositon table, only ~2x improvements, not too significant. Add principal variational search, neither significant. 
- key issue solved with MCTS, using greedy rollout strategy for evaluation (significant intelligence improvements)
- performance bottleneck profiling with valgrind, optimize movements generation for mcts virtual thinking chessboard, achieved 5x speedup
- performance bottleneck is still movement generation in mcts even after optimizing bruteforce movement generation, what's more, new and delete chessboard also costs about 10% of time
- MCTS tree reuse(only achieved 1/10 speedup since only 1/10 nodes in previous iteratin remains) and remove unused nodes recursively(prevent memory leak), get possible moves optimizatioin(), chessboard optimization(light and heavy version judge and move), achieved 5x speedup; chessboard copy constructor light version/shared static variables between different chessboards; get possible moves optimizatioin(stone generate valid moves); competition result of mcst-100000 and a-b-4, almost draw; position value instead of win/loss (failed try, not working); expoitation and explore balance, C_UCB parameter tuning(not working); bug to be fixed, mcts not considering cycles in simulations and could result in invalid cycling move in actual board move, and fix memory leak;
- TODO: test module
- TODO: to do parallelization;  next try alpha-beta search evaluation;
